# 🧑🏻 Bio
Hello! My name is Gang Liu(刘纲). I have just graduated from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) joint program, and obtained a **first-class degree, a ranking in the top 1%, an outstanding final project, and several publications**. My major is telecommunications engineering.

In the summer of 2024, I participated in the iSURE program at the **University of Notre Dame**, where I conducted research on physiological signal processing under the supervision of [Prof. Zhi Zheng](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/zhi-zheng/). My final year project was co-supervised by [Prof. Yixuan Zou](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~yz323/) of QMUL and [Prof. Yuanwei Liu](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~yuanwei/), IEEE Fellow of the University of Hong Kong.

I am currently preparing for research assistant (RA) positions for the period between Fall 2025 and Fall 2026, while also planning to apply for PhD programs starting in Fall 2026. You can reach me at:

# 🔬 Research Interests
I am driven by a research interest in leveraging signal processing to pioneer innovations in mobile health (mHealth) and affective computing. My work explores how different signal modalities can be harnessed for ubiquitous health monitoring and the objective assessment of emotional states.

My past projects demonstrate this focus. At the University of Notre Dame, I worked with physiological signals, specifically using Electrodermal Activity (EDA) to identify and quantify stress levels. Complementing this, my undergraduate thesis explored a novel approach using ambient wireless signals, where I implemented a self-supervised learning framework to recognize human activities from WiFi data. Through these diverse experiences, I aim to build systems that enable pervasive health awareness and empathetic technology.

# 🤪 Other Interesting Details

During my undergraduate years, I ventured into various fascinating fields. I had a brief experience conducting research on **Graph Neural Networks** at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I also explored **edge computing in communications** during Tsinghua University's AIR Winter Camp, where we aimed to better schedule base stations for optimal network resource allocation. At BUPT, I used **software-defined radio** equipment to measure spectrum resources across multiple areas in Beijing and conducted detailed analysis and prediction of these resources.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a wide range of personal interests. I'm a music enthusiast 🎶, and this year, I attended numerous concerts and livehouse performances, including Mayday. I’d like to recommend my favorite artist, [Novo Amor](https://novoamor.co.uk/), a highly talented Welsh singer. I also enjoy mixology 🍾, cooking 🧑‍🍳 (if not for research, my dream would be to become a great chef), traveling ✈️, and gaming 🎮. I once reached Diamond rank in League of Legends.

In closing, I am proud of the rich diversity of my journey thus far. The world's vastness calls for a lifetime of learning and exploration. I cherish this world as I cherish myself, and I am ready to embrace the chapters yet to come.

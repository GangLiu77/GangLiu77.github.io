# üßëüèª Bio
I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and Queen Mary University of London joint program.

From 2023 to 2024, I conducted research on wireless optical communication under the guidance of [Prof.Renzhi Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vuiBkVIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at **BUPT**. In the summer of 2024, I participated in the iSURE program at the **University of Notre Dame**, where I conducted research on physiological signal processing under the supervision of [Prof.Zhi Zheng](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/zhi-zheng/).

I am currently exploring research-focused master's opportunities, such as MPhil or MRes, and would be happy to connect if my profile aligns with your interests. You can reach me at:
gliu22@nd.edu | g.liu@se21.qmul.ac.uk.

# üî¨ Research Interests
My previous research primarily focused on **wireless communication**. Currently, my research interests lie in using **signal processing** techniques to enhance **health monitoring and disease diagnosis**.

# ü§™ Other Interesting Details

During my undergraduate years, I ventured into various fascinating fields. I had a brief experience conducting research on **Graph Neural Networks** at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I also explored **edge computing in communications** during Tsinghua University's AIR Winter Camp, where we aimed to better schedule base stations for optimal network resource allocation. At BUPT, I used **software-defined radio** equipment to measure spectrum resources across multiple areas in Beijing and conducted detailed analysis and prediction of these resources.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a wide range of personal interests. I'm a music enthusiast üé∂, and this year, I attended numerous concerts and livehouse performances, including Mayday. I‚Äôd like to recommend my favorite artist, [Novo Amor](https://novoamor.co.uk/), a highly talented Welsh singer. I also enjoy mixology üçæ, cooking üßë‚Äçüç≥ (if not for research, my dream would be to become a great chef), traveling ‚úàÔ∏è, and gaming üéÆ. I once reached Diamond rank in League of Legends.
